# A Book on C
This is a collection of notes and exercises from the book [A Book on C: An Introduction to Programming in C](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Programming-4th-Al-Kelley/dp/0201183994/ref=sr_1_1).

For each program in the chapter I recreate it and then fiddle with it. The exercises at the end of the chapter are listed as `ex_<exercise number>.c`.
